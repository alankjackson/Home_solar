## Develop a cost model

To analyze various solar buyback plans, I need to have an ERCoT model that will
let me estimate what sort of wholesale prices might be available.

```{r initialize}

library(tidyverse)

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Tulane_Solar/Data/"

df <- readRDS(paste0(path, "Ercot.rds"))

```

##  Plot the data

```{r initial plots}






```

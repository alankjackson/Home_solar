## Analyze Tesla data

The tesla data comes from several sources, so we will compare and contrast.

We have the original solar panels, which are on one account, the new solar
panels and batteries, on a different account, and for both we have data
downloaded from the app as well as data downloaded with python code off
the web.

```{r init}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Tulane_Solar/Data/"

Solar_old <- readRDS(paste0(path, "Solar_old.rds"))
Solar_new <- readRDS(paste0(path, "Solar_new.rds"))
App_old <- readRDS(paste0(path, "App_old.rds"))
App_new <- readRDS(paste0(path, "App_new.rds"))

```

##        Make some plots

```{r first plots}

```
